LinkedHashMap
---------------------------
LinkedHashMap
--------------
*MAP(I)->HashMap(C)->LinkedHashMap(C)
1.child interface of HashMap[I]
2.Undeline dataStructure is HashTable and LinkedList
3.same methods and constructrs as of  HashMap
4.Insertion order is preserved
5. is not synchronized.
 to get synchronized object ->  Map s = Collections.synchronizedSet(new LinkedHashMap(...));
NOTE: we cau use LinkedHashSet to develop cache based applications,
       where duplicates are not allowed and insertion order is preserved.

HashMap                                                 LinkedHashMap
1.datastructure -HashTable                              1.datastructure -HashTable and LinkedList
2.Insertion order is not preserved                      2.Insertion order is preserved
  and isertion order is based on hashcode
  of keys
