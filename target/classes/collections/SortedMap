SortedMap
----------------
Map(I)->SortedMap(I)->NavigableMap(I)->TreeMap(C)
1.Child Interface of Map
2. To represnt (key, value) pairs in some sorted order of keys
3.Sorting is based on key, not value
4.Methods
    1.Object firstKey():Returns the first (lowest) key currently in this map.
    2.Object lastKey():Returns the last (highest) key currently in this map.
    3.SortedMap headKey(E toElement):Returns a view of the portion of this map whose keys are strictly less than toKey.()
    4.SortedMap tailKey(E fromElement):Returns a view of the portion of this map whose keys are greater than or equal to fromKey.
    5.SortedMap subKey(E fromElement, E toElement):Returns a view of the portion of this map whose keys range from fromKey, inclusive, to toKey, exclusive.
    6.Comparator comparator():Returns the comparator used to order the keys in this map, or null if this map uses the natural ordering of its keys

Example
101->A
102->B
103->C
104->D
105->E
106->F

firstKey()-> 101
lastKey()->106
headKey(105) ->{100=A,102=B,103=C,104=D}
tailKey(104)->{104=D,105=E,106=F}
subKey(103,105)->{103=C,104=D}
Comparator() null
