SINGLETON OBJECTS IN SCALA
=================================================================================
Singleton object is an object which is declared by using object keyword instead by class.
No object is required to call methods declared inside singleton object.

There is no static keyword in Scala, instead we have singleton objects.
All we need is to use object keyword to create a singleton object.
We can call it’s methods directly, we can’t pass parameters to its primary constructor.
Below is a quick example of singleton objects in Scala.

HOW TO CREATE STATIC MEMBERS WITH SCALA COMPANION OBJECTS
=================================================================================
Define non-static (instance) members in your class, and define members that you want to appear as
“static” members in an object that has the same name as the class, and is in the same file as the
class. This object is known as a companion object.
================================================================================
Companion objects
An object with the same name as a class is called a companion object. Conversely,
the class is the object’s companion class. A companion class or object can access the
private members of its companion. Use a companion object for methods and values which are not
specific to instances of the companion class.
