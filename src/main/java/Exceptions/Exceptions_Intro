1.Runtime Stack Mechanism
for every thread jvm will create a runtime stack.Each method call performed by that thread is stored in stack.
Each entry in stack is called "stack frame"/"activation record".
After completing method call, corresponding entry from stack is removed.After completing all the method calls,
the corresponding stack will become empty and that empty stack is destroyed by jvm , just before
terminating the thread
