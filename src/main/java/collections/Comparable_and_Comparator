Comparable[I]
-------------------
1.present in java.lang package
2.one method - compareTo
3.for default sorting order
 Public int compareTo(Object obj)
   e.g obj1.compareTo(obj2);
  returns -ve  if obj1 has to come before obj2
  returns +ve  if obj1 has to come after obj2
  returns 0  if obj1 is equal to  obj2

NOTE: if default sorting order is not required and we need customised sorting order, go for Comparator[I]
Comparable[I]-default sorting order
Comparator[I]-customised sorting order

Comparator[I]
------------------
1.present in java.util package
2.two methods - compare() and equals
--  Public int compare(Object obj1,Object obj2)
     returns -ve  if obj1 > obj2 (obj1 has to come before obj2)
     returns +ve  if obj1 < obj2 (obj1 has to come after obj2)
     returns 0  if obj1 is equal to  obj2

--Public boolean equals(Object obj)
Note: While we implement Comparato[I] we should provide implementation only for  compare() and not required to implement equals
      coz , its is already available to our class from Object class through Inhertance

NOTE:
Comparable vs Comparator
1.For predefined Comparable class default sorting order is already available, if we not need the default sorting order we can
  define our own sorting order by using comparator
2.For predefined non Comparable class(StringBuffer ) default sorting order is not available, hence we can
    define our own sorting order by using comparator
3.For our own classes like  Employee, person who is writing that class is responsible to define default natural sorting order by implementing comparable[I]
4.Person who is not satisfied with default natural sorting order, then he can define his own sorting by using Comparator[I]

Comparable                                                     Comparator
1.default sorting order                                      1.customised sorting order
2.java.lang                                                  2.java.util
3.compareTo                                                  3.compare() and equals() methods
4.String and all wrapper classed implements                  4.Only implemented classes of Comparator[I] are Collator and RuleBasedCollator
