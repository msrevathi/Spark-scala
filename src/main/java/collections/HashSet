HashSet
--------------
Collection[I]->Set[I]->HashSet(C)
1.child interface of Set[I]
4.Undeline dataStructure is HashTable
2.To represent group of objects as single entity where duplicates are not allowed and insertion is not preserved
3.Constructors
   a.HashSet h = new HashSet(); : Constructs a new, empty set; the backing HashMap instance
       has default initial capacity (16) and load factor (0.75).
   b.HashSet h = HashSet(int initialCapacity)
      :Constructs a new, empty set; the backing HashMap instance has the specified initial
        capacity and default load factor (0.75).
   c.HashSet h = HashSet(int initialCapacity, float loadFactor)
      :Constructs a new, empty set; the backing HashMap instance has
        the specified initial capacity and the specified load factor.
   d.HashSet h = HashSet(Collection  c)
     :Constructs a new set containing the elements in the specified collection.
4.is not synchronized.
 to get synchronized object ->   Set s = Collections.synchronizedSet(new HashSet(...));
NOTE:
loadFactor/Fill ratio - the load factor of the hash map; after filling how much ratio a new HasSet object is created
e.g loadFactor/Fill ratio = .075 -> after filling 75% of HashSet, a new HashSet is created
