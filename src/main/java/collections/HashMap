HashMap[I]
---------------
 *MAP(I)->HashMap(C)
 1.dataStructure is Hashtable
 2.Insertion order is not preserved and based on  Hash code of keys
 3.Duplicate key not allowed, but duplicate values are allowed
 4.Heterogeneous objects are allowed for both key and value
 5.null is allowed for key(only once)
 6.null is allowed for value(multiple times)
 7.implements Serializable(I) and clonable[I], not RandomAccess[I]
 8.Best if frequent operation is search
 9.Constructors
     a.HashMap h = new HashMap() : Constructs empty HashMap with  default initial capacity (16) and load factor (0.75).
     b.HashMap h = new HashMap(int initialCapacity) :Constructs empty  HashMap with specified initial capacity and default load factor (0.75).
     c.HashMap h = new HashMap(int initialCapacity, float loadFactor) :Constructs empty  HashMap with the specified initial capacity and the specified load factor.
     d.HashMap h = HashMap(Map  c):Created equivalent HashMap if specified Map

HashMap vs HashTable

HashMap                                  HashTable
1.methods are non-synchronised          1.methods are synchronised
2.Multiple threads are allowed          2.Only one thread is allowed to operate at a time
to operate ,hence not thread              Hence thread safe
safe
3.Relatively high performance coz       3.Relatively low performance coz threads are  needed to wait to
threads are not needed to wait to       operate on Vector Object
operate on ArrayList Object
4.Non-legacy(1.2)                       4.legacy(1.0)
5.null key(once) and values are allowed 5.null key and values are not allowed

Question: How to get synchronised of HashMap
By default, HashMap is non-synchronised, but we can get synchronised version of HashMap like below

 HashMap a = new HashMap()
 Map m = Collections.synchronisedList(a)

 Now m is a synchronisedList version of HashMap
