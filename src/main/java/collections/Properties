Properties
------------------
java.util package
1.The Properties class represents a persistent set of properties.
2.In our program if anythings which changes frequently like userName ,password,mobile are not recommended to hardcode in Java.
  coz i there is any change in those,to reflect thta change, recompilation, rebuild and re deploy of application required.
  also server restart sometimes which in trun impacts business client
3.We can overcome this issue using Properties file.Such type of variable things we have to configure in Properties file.
  From Properties file , read into java program and use those Properties.
  Main adv of this approach is if there is a change in Properties file, to reflect that change, just re-deployment
  is enough , which will not create business impact to client.
4.We can use java Properties object to hold Properties from Properties file
5.In normal map like hashmap, hashtable, treemap key and value can be any type, but in Properties, key and values should be
  String type
6.Constructors
