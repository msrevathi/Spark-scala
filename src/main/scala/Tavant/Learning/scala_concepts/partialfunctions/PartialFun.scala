/*
As the name suggests, partial functions are only partial implementations. They do not cover
every possible scenario of incoming parameters. A partial function caters to only a subset of
possible data for which it has been defined. In order to assist developers, if the partial function
is defined for a given input, Scala's PartialFunction trait provides the isDefinedAt method.
The isDefinedAt method can be queried if it can handle a given value.
