/*
Scala Closures are functions which uses one or more free variables and the return value
of this function is dependent of these variable. The free variables are defined outside
of the Closure Function and is not included as a parameter of this function. So the difference
between a closure function and a normal function is the free variable. A free variable is any
kind of variable which is not defined within the function and not passed as the parameter of
the function. A free variable is not bound to a function with a valid value. The function does
not contain any values for the free variable.
